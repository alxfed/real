PLSS Line
The County's system of tax maps is based on the Illinois
Public Land Survey System (PLSS). In the PLSS, each township
is divided into 36 sections, and each section into four
quarter-sections. A quarter-section is further divided into
two tax map sheets, often called "pages". Each tax map
(1/4 mile by 1/2 mile) represents the east or west half of
one quarter-section, and typically there are eight tax maps
per section.
